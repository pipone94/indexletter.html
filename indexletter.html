   <br> Dear Eileen,<br>

   <br> Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Faculty of Science at <a href="http://example.com."> Université Génialissime</a> to

    We are happy that you can start your studies with us at any time, but we prefer that you start at the
    beginning of a semester; the start dates for each semester are as follows:

    <br> <p> Study subjects</p>

   <br><p> the Faculty of Genius Sciences, we have a great openness in research, as long as the subjects fall
    within the field of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent and dedicated researcher, just the
    kind of person we would like to have on our team. That said, among the ideas you submitted, the ones
    that intrigued us the most are the following, in order of priority:</p>
    
<br><p> H2O into wine, and the health benefits of resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).
    Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures above 30°C (86°F), when
    audience size increases exponentially (effect from 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)
    Constructions in HTML and CSS for the representation of musical scores.</p>
    
    <br><p> can you provide us with more information on each of these topics, including the expected duration of the
    research, the staff and other resources needed, and anything else we should know? Thank you.</p>
    
    <br> <p> please accept, Madam, the expression of my distinguished sentiments,</p>
    
   <br> <p>Dr Eleanor Gaye
